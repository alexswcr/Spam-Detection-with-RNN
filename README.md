# Spam-Detection-with-RNN vs LSTMs
Google Colab notebook containing the step-by-step process of training a RNN model to detect spam text messages. This was created as part of my coursework for Applied Machine Learning (Year 2 Semester 2)

## How to Use
Open the notebook in Google Colab and sequentially run each code block. The code blocks will go through each step of the process (like data cleaning, preprocessing and model training + evaluation).

## Why 2 Models?
This notebook was a part of a project aimed at evaluating the performance of different models at a given task. In this case, the comparison is between a simple RNN and a LSTM model. Both of these models are evaluated using a confusion matrix and analysis on failure cases.
